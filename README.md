# Disable $ Highlighting for PHP $variables

Does what it says on the tin! That is to say it stops Atom from including $ in the selection when double clicking a PHP $variable;

## Installation

* In Atom, open *Settings* (*Preferences* on Mac)
* Go to *Install* section
* Search for `language-php-no-dollar-highlight` package. Once found, click `Install` button.
* Done!
